3. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its range?
    A: It overflows to the int.MinValue and increments positively from there

4. What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;?
    A1: x = y++ will leave x as the original y value, and then will increment y. So after running x = y++; x    will by the original y, and y will now be y +1
    A2: x = ++y; will increment y first, and then assign the incremented value to x. So after running x = ++y; x is y+1 and y is y+1.
